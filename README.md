## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eray TÃ¼rkay

I'm an open-source developer doing my best to contribute and build tools that (hopefully) make your life a bit easier. If youâ€™ve found my work helpful or interesting, consider buying me a coffee to show your support! ðŸ’›

Every little bit helpsâ€”it keeps me motivated and gives me more time to improve existing projects and create new ones. Thanks a ton! ðŸ™Œ
